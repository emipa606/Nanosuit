Introducing the Crysis Nanosuit. Inspired by the Crysis series, the Nanosuit is brought into the Rimworld universe.

All of the modes/functions use energy which is configurable in the [Apparel_Various.xml] file.
I've made the Nanosuit to be overpowered since the suit is supposed to make whoever wearing it, a one-man-army.
A LOT of things are configurable via the XML file so if you feel it to be overpowered/underpowered, please customize it to your liking. I believe in the power of customization. Please DO share your settings in the discussions tab.

**CE COMPATIBLE**
